# React-Multiple-Todo
Multiple Todo List built with React

This was actually a challenge application for a job inerview. I didn't get the job but most importantly this prepared me for future
interviews and definitely helped in building up my confidence. As most self taught dev's, imposter syndrome can creep in and have 
you feeling un-worthy of your intended goal.

### ADVICE

#### Start Interviewing NOW!!!!

Even if you are just starting out, you have to get use to the questions. The style of Dev interviews are different, and I immediately
realized that if I would have been practicing up to this point, I would have developed a system for answering certain questions
(D-structures and Algorithms) and a prepared setup for quickly banging out any code.
